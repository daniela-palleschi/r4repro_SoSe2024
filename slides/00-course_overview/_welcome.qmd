# Course Moodle

Course name: Open Science Practices: Implementing a Reproducible Analysis Workflow
Enrolment Key: r4repro

- course documents are available as HTML slides and PDF
- a course website will be up and running shortly

## Learning objectives

- learn basic concepts of Open Science in the scope of language research
  + focus on reproducibile analysis
- create and maintain self-contained analyses projects
- develop good habits for project management
- learn how to transparently write up analyses for a paper or thesis
- learn about concepts like version control and containerization

## What you will not learn in this book

- how to analyse data
- how to fit models
- how to plot data
- how to design an experiment

- we will not explicitly learn how to do these things, although we will be running simple code to achieve these goals

# Session Info {.unlisted .unnumbered visibility="uncounted"}

Save your session info at the end of each document. Our results very often depend on the version of R/RStudio/a package we used. This is a great first step towards creating a reproducible workflow!

```{r}
