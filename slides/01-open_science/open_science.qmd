# What is Open Science?

> ‚ÄúOpen science‚Äù is an umbrella term used to refer to the concepts of openness, transparency, rigor, reproducibility, replicability, and accumulation of knowledge, which are considered fundamental features of science‚Äù

--- @cruwell_seven_2019, p.3

- a movement developed to respond to crisis in scientific research
  + lack of accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, and replicability of previous research
- transparency is key to all facets of Open Science
  + it allows for full evaluation of all stages of science
  
- Open Access, software, data, code, materials...

## Systemic problem in science

- the combination of
  - publication bias
    + journals favour novel, significant findings
  - publish or perish
    + researchers' careers depend on publications

- can/does/did lead to:
  - HARKing
    + Hypothesising After Results are Known
  - p-hacking
    + (re-)running analyses until a significant effect is found
  - replication crisis
    + pervasive failure to replicate previous research
  
# Why do Open Science?

- open science is good science
- it encourages organisation and planning
  + helpful for future you
- increases *transparency*
  + without transparency we cannot inspect evidence ourselves
  + or ensure the claims match the evidence

- makes our work more robust
  + so future work stands on solid ground

# How to do Open Science?

- not all-or-nothing
- there are things I consider the bare minimum
  + detailed experiment plan, ideally public
  + openly available materials (e.g., stimuli)
  + share code and data

- the important thing is to do what you can

# Eight Steps to Open Science

```{r echo = F, fig.env = "figure", out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", set.cap.width=T, fig.cap="Image source: @kathawalla_easing_2021 (all rights reserved)"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("media/Kathawalla_research_cycle.png"))
```

## Journal Club

- level: Easy

- e.g., [ReproducibiliTea Berlin](https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/en/commitments/research-quality/quality/faq-trainings/reproducibilitea.html)
  + discuss topics and share knowledge on Open Science Practices


## Project Workflow

- level: Easy

- folder structure
  + how to sensibly set up your folders
- contained environments
  + using RProjects and the `here` package
- data management
  + establishing some data storage convention
- version control
  + e.g., git, GitHub/GitLab, OSF

## Preprints

- level: Easy

- manuscript version publicly available
  + prior to peer review
  + during peer review
  + after publication
- allows for a wider audience
  + earlier feedback
  + actually *increases* citation count
- typically found on (psy)arXiv, OSF

## Reproducible Code

- level: Medium

- with open source software (R, RStudio, packages)
- literate programming
- dynamic reports with Quarto/Rmarkdown
- reproducibility goes hand-in-hand with project workflow and data management

- ideally:
  + avoid GUI (Graphic User Interface with point-and-click, e.g., SPSS)
  + avoid propreitary software (paid licences, e.g., SPSS, Matlab)
  + use open software (e.g., R, Python)
  + use a programming language and include useful comments

## Data sharing

- level: Medium

- publicly sharing your data
  + including raw data (if possible)
- allows for reproduction of analyses
- takes forethought and experience
- documentation and naming conventions are important
  + e.g., data dictionaries/codebooks

## Transparent writing

- level: Medium

- transparency regarding
  + methods/procedure
  + hypotheses (confirmatory vs. exploratory)
  + data analyses
- an experiment plan or lab notebook are key!

## Preregistration

- level: Medium

- a timestamped and (often) public plan of:
  + research questions
  + hypotheses
  + method
  + analyses
- clearly state intentions and predictions for *confirmatory* analyses
  + everything else is exploratory
- templates available on [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org/) and the [OSF](https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration)

## Registered Report

- level: Difficult

- submitting the introduction, methods, analysis plan to a journal before data collection
  + if accepted: publication regardless of the result
- a more detailed pre-registration, often with fully written sections
- much more time consuming before data collection can begin
  + journal acceptance can take months
